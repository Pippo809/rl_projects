# RL related projects.

Right now I worked on: 
- [Imitaion Learning](imitation_learning): From Vanilla Imitation Learning to DAgger, where the agent learns from expert's demonstrations.
- [Policy Gradient](policy_gradients): Vanilla Policy Gradient, Neural Network Baselines, Advantage Estimation and Generalized Advantage Estimation.
